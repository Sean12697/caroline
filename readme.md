# Caroline (Your Careerer Online)

This is the GitHub repo for the demo made at the 'Free Your Mind' Hackathon by Code Nation & EMIS Health.

The concept of this project was to be able to stage intervetions for a given person via tracking their habbits and any changes in them (being able to indicate a varity issues).

Ideally a carer or therapist of sorts would use this tool that would connect to a persons smart meters (electricty and water usage) along with their social media, although in the time of the hack we were only able to complete part of the social media profiling (shown below).
